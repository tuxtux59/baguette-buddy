# baguette-buddy

Best fullstack web app mate for cooking and groceries

Quite inspired by [Grocy](grocy.info).

The main purpose here is to focus on two main improvements about **Grocy**:

1. Integrate a relation between units and reduce struggling while choosing the right unit for ingredients in recipes (eg: sppon, liter, centiliter...).
2. Detect ingredients and units automatically in the description of recipes (eg: "500 g Kartoffeln").


Secondly is to offer two options for both ends

1. Backend on Ruby on Rails (ROR) or Elixir (Erl)
2. Frontend with ReactJS and React Native (RN).
